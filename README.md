# Frontend Mentor - Todo app

![Design preview for the Todo app coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is my try at this front-end coding challenge.

## The challenge

Your challenge was to build out this todo app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I could use any tools I liked to help you complete the challenge. 
So I decided to use vanilla JS and work with the native browser APIs to complete it

I had a lot of fun making it, and deployed so you can try it out

Hope you like it.
